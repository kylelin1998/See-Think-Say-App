**See Think Say App** is a cross-platform software based on ChatGPT. For now, supports Android, Windows, and Linux. 

You can run it everywhere to use. The software UI is clean and simple to focus on the chat.

There are some matters about the settings of this software that we need to discuss. You can choose whether to request the ChatGPT API through a proxy and switch between the Chinese and English languages. Additionally, you can customize the GPT model settings.

This app only requests ChatGPT Api and Github for requesting update data and no other.
