See Think Say App is a cross-platform software based on ChatGPT. For now, supports Android, IOS, Windows, MacOS, Linux, and Web.
You can run it everywhere to use. The software UI is clean and simple to focus on the chat.

There are some matters about the settings of this software that we need to discuss. You can choose whether to request the ChatGPT API through a proxy and switch between the Chinese and English languages. Additionally, you can customize the GPT model settings.

This app only requests ChatGPT Api and Github for requesting update data and no other, the chat data is stored locally.

The main features are:
1. Quick text reply
2. Record and replay conversations
3. Can be used with the web version regardless of the network environment, meaning no need to use a proxy.
